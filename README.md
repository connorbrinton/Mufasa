# Mufasa
Mufasa is a Chrome extension designed to help you avoid distracting webpages. Whenever you try to visit a distracting webpage, Mufasa redirects you to a less distracting page on the same website. This allows you to use the website for its productive purposes, while preventing you from becoming distracted.

# Websites
## Facebook
By default, Mufasa redirects `facebook.com` to `facebook.com/connor.brinton` (my profile). For your own use, you can edit the redirect url in `background.js` to redirect to your own profile. Mufasa also hides the `Ticker News Feed` that is typically shown in the upper-right hand corner of every Facebook page.
## YouTube
By default, Mufasa redirects `youtube.com` to `youtube.com/user/MormonMessagesYouth/videos`. For your own use, you can edit the redirect url in `background.js` to redirect to your own favorite YouTube channel.
## Amazon MP3
Mufasa redirects the `Amazon MP3 Landing Page` to the `Amazon MP3 Adanced Search Page`.

# Roadmap
## Version 2.0
* A "dynamic profile loader" that determines the user's Facebook url at runtime.
* An options page that allows the user to customize the YouTube redirect url.

If anyone is interested in developing any of these features for Mufasa, please let me know at <connor.brinton@gmail.com>.
